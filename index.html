					<p>I am Austin and I am 11 years old. I go to Diamond Middle School.</p>
					<p>I like to code and I like playing the piano and saxophone.</p>
					<p>Here is the introduction to an essay I wrote in 3rd grade explaining why kids should have more recess:</p>
					<p>Of all the subjects in school, reading, writing, math and social studies, which one is your favorite? It’s probably  one of these, but my favorite is recess. Most people think our 15 minute recess break is a good amount of time. Some might even think it’s too long! But I think it’s too short. That's why I think that kids should have more recess time because it’s healthy, because it gets rid of stress and most of all because it’s fun.</p>
